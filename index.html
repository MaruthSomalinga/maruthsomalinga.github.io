    <h1>Claim</h1>
    <p>The key structure of the model black box was its tubing that connected the tube to the other tube that was connected to the water canister. I don’t think that our model recreated the black box accurately but I do think that the general idea of our model was right. The specificis might be changed. </p>
    <h1>Evidence</h1>
    <p>The black box had something inside of it that stopped the water from coming through. A trend that I saw in the data was that for every 5 trials with 500 ml more than 500 ml came out. The way we went about figuring out what was inside the black was visually observing it and getting backed up by the data that was collected. We tested the model by pouring water down the funnel and seeing how much water came back(Input and output). The way we knew we could possibly be on the right track is when the data results of our model matched the results of the actual black box. The key structure of the model black box is the tubing branching off to the water canister. In some of the trials there was more water coming out than we put in and in some other tests less water came out than we poured in. We wanted to see how the patterns would differ from the actual box so we put 500 ml on the first trial and compared it to the data. </p>
    <h1>Reasoning part 1</h1>
    <p> Models, conceptually, are representations of what could be. They explain what could possibly be happening, it tests out your theory.</p>
    <h1>Reasoning part 2</h1>
    <p> Our claim should be believed because of the data that is collected. The data that was collected from the black box shows the trends of taking in more water then letting out less, then after that putting in more water gets even more water, with a steady amount. </p>
    <h1>Reasoning part 3</h1>
    <p> If there was not a canister inside the black box collecting excess water then we would have observed different results in our tests of the mystery black box.  Specifically, we would have seen more water coming out consistently.  Because we didn’t get water consistently, we can conclude that there is something in the box collecting water.</p>
